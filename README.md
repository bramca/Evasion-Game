# Evasion Game
![evasion game](./img/evasion_game.PNG)
*Created in 2017*<br>
One of my very first javascript games created.<br>
It is written in pure `javascript` and `html`.

# How to run
You can run this game by opening the [index.html](./index.html) in your browser or you can run a simple http server in the root folder of this repo e.g. (in python) `python -m http.server`

# Controls
`arrow keys` to move up/down/left/right. If you cross the left or right game border it will spawn you on the other side.<br>
`p` pause the game.<br>
`r` if it is Game Over you can press this to restart the game.
